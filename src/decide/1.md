- Let M be an arbitrary Turing machine.

	```kotlin
	val M = { w: Input -> TODO() }
	```

	(a) Describe a Turing machine N: Accept(N) = Reject(M) and Reject(N) = Accept(M).

	```kotlin
	val N = { w: Input -> !M(w) }
	```

	We see that Accept(N) = {w : M(w) == false} = Reject(M). And Reject(N) = {w : M(w) == true} = Accept(M).

	(b) Describe a Turing machine N: Accept(N) = Accept(M) and Reject(N) = EMPTY.

	```kotlin
	val N = { w: String ->
		if (M(w)) true
		else loop()
	}
	```

	We see that Accept(N) = Accept(M). And in all other cases, N will hang and reject nothing.

	(c) Describe a Turing machine N: Accept(N) = Halt(M) and Reject(N) = EMPTY.

	```kotlin
	val N = { w: String ->
		M(w)
		true
	}
	```

	We see that N accepts w iff. M halts. And N does not reject input (either accept or hang).

- (a) Prove that Accept is undecidable.

	Suppose a Turing Machine Acc decides Accept.

	```kotlin
	val Acc = { M: TuringMachine, w: String -> TODO() }
  ```
  
  Now we construct another Turing Machine N as follows:
  
  ```{kotlin}
	val N = { w: String -> !Acc(N, w) }
  ```
  
  We see that N accepts w iff. Acc(N, w) = false, i.e. N rejects w. This is a contradiction.

	(b) Prove that Reject is undecidable.
	(c) Prove that Diverge is undecidable
