- For each of the following decision problems, either sketch an algorithm or prove that theproblem is undecidable. Recall that w^R denotes the reversal of string w. For each problem,the input is the encoding <M> of a Turing machine M.

	(a) Does M reject the empty string?

	We can prove by Rice's Reject Theorem. Let P = {languages containing empty string, e}

	Consider `Y: TM = { w: Input -> return w.isNotEmpty() }` and N = M_ACC.

	We see that Reject(Y) = {e}, which is in P. And Reject(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P. Therefore, {<M> : Reject(M) in P} is undecidable. 

	(b) Does M accept <M>^R?

	Suppose MR decides if M accepts <M>^R. We can solve the halting problem as follows:

	```kotlin
	val Halt: TM2 = { M: TM, w: Input ->
		val N = { x: Input ->
	  		M(w)
	        true
	    }
	    MR(N)
	}
	```

	I claim that M halts on w iff. MR(N) == true, i.e. N accepts <N>^R.

	- Suppose M halts on w. Then N accepts all input. More specifically, N accepts <N>^R.
	- Suppose M does NOT halt on w. Then N does NOT accept any input. More specifically, N does NOT accept <N>^R, i.e. MR(N) == false.

	(c) Does M accept <M><M>?

	Similar proof as shown in (b).

	(d) Does M accept <M>^k for any integer k?

	Similar proof as shown in (b).

	(e) Does M accept the encoding of any Turing machine?

	We can prove by Rice's Theorem. Let P = {languages containing any Turing machine encodings}.

	Consider `Y: TMD = { M: TM -> true }` and N = M_REJ.

	We see that Accept(Y) is all Turing machines, which is in P. (Otherwise, we will go into runtime error. This is just a trick for checking valid Turing machines). And Accept(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P. Therefore deciding whether a Turing machine accepts any Turing machine encodings is undecidable.

	(f) Is there a Turing machine that accepts <M>?

	Sure. M_ACC accepts ALL <M> since it accepts any Input.

	(g) Is <M> a palindrome?

	Given <M> as Input, which is just a String, we can easily check whether it is a palindrome in O(n) time.

	```kotlin
	fun Encoding.isPalindrome(): Boolean {
	    var start = 0
	    var end = length
	    if (end <= 1) {
	        return true
	    }
	    
	    while (start < end) {
	        if (this[start] != this[end]) {
	            return false
	        }
	        start++
	        end--
	    }
	    return true
	}
	```

	(h) Does M reject any palindrome?

	Prove by Rice's Reject Theorem. Let P = {languages containing palindromes}

	Consider `Y: TM = { w: Input -> w != "abcdcba" }` and N = M_ACC.

	We see that Reject(Y) = {"abcdcba"}, which is in P. And Reject(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P. Therefore {<M> : M reject any palindrome} is undecidable. 

	(i) Does M accept all palindromes?

	Prove by Rice's Theorem. Let P = {languages containing all palindromes}

	Consider Y = M_ACC and N = M_REJ

	We see that Accept(Y) = Sigma*, which is in P. And Accept(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P. Therefore {<M> : M accepts all palindromes} is undecidable.

	(j) Does M diverge only on palindromes?

	Prove by Rice's Diverge Theorem. Let P = {{all palindromes}}

	Consider `Y: TM = { w: Input -> if (w.isPalindrome()) loop() else halt() }` and N = M_HALT.

	We see that Diverge(Y) = {all palindromes}, which is in P. And Diverge(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P. Therefore, {<M> : M diverges ONLY on palindomes} is undecidable.

	(k) Is there an input string that forces M to move left?

	We know that NeverLeft is decidable. So is its complement: EverLeft.

	(l) Is there an input string that forces M to move left three times in a row?

	This is undecidable.

	(m) Does M accept the encoding of any Turing machine N: Accept(N) = SelfDiverge?

	Prove by Rice's Theorem. Let P = {languages containing {<T> : Accept(T) = SelfDiverge}}, where SelfDiverge = {<M> : M diverges on <M>}.

	Consider Y = M_ACC, and N = M_REJ.

	We see that Accept(Y) = Sigma*, which is in P since Sigma* contains all Encodings. And Accept(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P.

	Therefore {<T> : Accept(T) in P} = {<T> : T accepts any language containing { \<S\> : Accept(S) = SelfDiverge}} is undecidable.

- For each problem, the input is an encoding <M,w> of a Turing machine M and Input w.

	(a) Does M accept the string ww^R?

	Let P = {{ww^R}}. Let `Y: TM = { x: Input -> return x == w + w.reversed() }` and N = M_REJ. Thus this is undecidable by Rice's Theorem.

	(b) Does M accept either w or w^R?

	Let P = {{w, w^R}}. Let `Y: TM = { x: Input -> return x == w || x == w.reversed() }` and N = M_REJ. Thus this is undecidable by Rice's Theorem.

	(c) Does M either accept w or reject w^R?

	Suppose AccWRejWR decides this.

	```kotlin
	val Halt: TM2 = { M: TM, w: Input ->
	                 val N = { x: Input ->
	                 	M(w)
	                    if (x == w) {
	                        true
	                    }
	                    if (x == w.reversed()) {
	                        false
	                     }
	                     
	                 }
	                 return AccWRejWR(N)
	}
	```

	- Suppose M halts on w. Then N accepts w and rejects w^R.
	- Suppose M does NOT halt on w. Then N neither accepts w nor rejects w^R.

	(d) Does M accept the string w^k for some integer k?

	Let P = {{w^k : for all integer k}}. Consider N = M_REJ and

	```kotlin
	val w: String = TODO() // given global variable w
	val Y: TM = { x: Input ->
		var i = 0
	    while (true) {
	          if (x == w * i) {
	               true
	           }
	    }
	    // actually we will not reject x even
	    // if x != w * i, for all integer i
	    // but that's fine anyway
	    false
	}

	operator fun String.times(i: Int) = repeat(i)
	```

	We see that Accept(Y) is in P and Accept(N) = EMPTY, which is NOT in P. Therefore, this is undecidable by Rice's Theorem.

	(e) Does M accept w in at most 2^|w| steps?

	Run M on w with at most 2^|w| steps. Reject if M does NOT accept w in these finite number of steps. Accept otherwise.

	(f) If we run M on input w, does M ever change a symbol on its tape?

	​

	(g) If we run M on input w, does M ever move to the right?

	​

	(h) If we run M on input w, does M ever move to the right twice in a row?

	​

	(i) If we run M on input w, does M move its head to the right more than 2^|w| times (notnecessarily consecutively)?

	​

	(j) If we run M with input w, does M ever change a on the tape to any other symbol?

	​

	(k) If we run M with input w, does M ever change a  on the tape to 1?

	​

	(l) If we run M with input w, does M ever write a @?

	​

	(m) If we run M with input w, does M ever leave its start state?

	​

	(n) If we run M with input w, does M ever reenter its start state?

	​

	(o) If we run M with input w, does M ever reenter a state that it previously left? That is, are there states p != q : M moves from state p to state q and then later movesback to state p?
